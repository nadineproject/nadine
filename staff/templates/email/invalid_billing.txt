Hi {{ user.first_name }}! 

It looks like we need to update your billing information at {{ site.name }}. When you get a chance, can you please update your information? You can enter your billing information right from your Nadine profile. Just go to the billing tab and create a new billing profile.  Once you have entered your information we'll do the rest.  You can also pay by automatic withdrawal from your checking account if you give us a voided check. Just let us know what you would like to do. Thanks!  

http://{{ site.domain }}{% url "members.views.profile_redirect" %}

If you have any questions, feel free to call 206.323.6500, respond to this message, or stop by the front desk. 

Thanks!
The {{ site.name }} Team
