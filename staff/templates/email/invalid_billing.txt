Hi {{ user.first_name }}!

It looks like we need to update your billing information at {{ site.name }}. When you get a chance, can you please update your information? You can enter your billing information right from your Nadine profile. Just go to the billing tab and create a new billing profile.  Once you have entered your information we'll do the rest.  You can also pay by automatic withdrawal from your checking account if you give us a voided check. Just let us know what you would like to do. Thanks!

If you have any questions, feel free to call 206.323.6500, respond to this message, or stop by the front desk.

Thanks!
The {{ site.name }} Team
