Welcome to the Nadine! 

There are a few steps to creating a new password. First things first, head to the link below to create your new password:
{% block reset_link %}
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url "django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm" uidb36=uid token=token %}
{% endblock %}
After you have created your new password you'll be sent to the login page.  

Thanks! If you have any questions, please swing by the front desk and chat with us.
